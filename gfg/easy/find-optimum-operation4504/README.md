![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a number  **n**. Find the minimum number of operations required to reach n starting from 0.

You have two operations available:

- Double the number
- Add one to the number

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: 0 + 1 = 1 --> 1 + 1 = 2 --> 2  *2 = 4 --> 4*  2 = 8.

```

```
Input: n = 7
Output: 5
Explanation: 0 + 1 = 1 --> 1 + 1 = 2 --> 1 + 2 = 3 --> 3 * 2 = 6 --> 6 + 1 = 7.
```

```py
class Solution:
    def minOperation(self, n):
        count = 0
        while n > 0:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n //= 2
            else:
                n -= 1
            count += 1
        return count
```
