# Any Duplicate Within K Distance

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array of integers,  **arr[]**  and an integer  **k**, check whether there exist two distinct indices i and j such that arr[i] is equal to arr[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 4, 5, 1], k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The element 5 occurs at indices 1 and 3. Their distance is |3 - 1| = 2, which is less than or equal to k.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 2, 3, 4, 10, 5], k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The element 10 occurs at indices 0 and 4. Their distance is |4 - 0| = 4, which is greater than k. Hence, no duplicate exists within the given distance.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 1, 3, 2, 4], k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: All elements are distinct, so no duplicate exists.
```

    def checkWithinK(self, arr: list[int], k: int) -> bool:
        last = {}
        for i, x in enumerate(arr):
            if x in last and i - last[x] <= k:
                return True
            last[x] = i
        return False
```
