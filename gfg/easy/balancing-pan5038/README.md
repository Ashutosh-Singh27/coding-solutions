# Balancing with Distinct Powers

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a simple weighing scale with two pans, a target weight  **b**, and a set of weights where each weight is a distinct power of  **a**, find if the scale can be balanced such that:

b + (some powers of a) = (some other powers of a)

 **Note:**  Exactly one weight is available for each power of a, so each power can be used at most once.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: a = 4, b = 11
Output: true
Explanation: 11 + 4 + 1 = 16. So, target = 11 can be balanced using powers of 4.
```

```
Input: a = 3, b = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 5 + 3 + 1 = 9. So, target = 5 can be balanced using powers of 3.
```

class Solution:
    def balancePan(self, a, b):
        while b > 0:
            r = b % a
            if r == 0 or r == 1:
                b //= a
            elif r == a - 1:
                b = b // a + 1
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
