# Ways to Reach Origin

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Geek is standing at a point  **(x, y)**  on a 2D grid and wants to reach the origin (0, 0).

From any point, Geek can move in only two directions: left, from (x, y) to (x - 1, y), or down, from (x, y) to (x, y - 1).

Find the total number of distinct paths for Geek to reach (0, 0) from (x, y). Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109+7.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: x = 3, y = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible path is (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0), since y = 0, there is no option to move down at any step.
```

```
Input: x = 3, y = 6
Output: 84
Explanation: There are a total of 84 distinct paths from (3, 6) to (0, 0) using only left and down moves.
```

```py
class Solution:
    def ways(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        n = x + y
        k = min(x, y)
        num = 1
        den = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            num = num * (n - k + i) % MOD
            den = den * i % MOD
        return num * pow(den, MOD - 2, MOD) % MOD
```
