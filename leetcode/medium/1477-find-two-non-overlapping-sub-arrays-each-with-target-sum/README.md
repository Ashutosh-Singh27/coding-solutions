# Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find  **two non-overlapping sub-arrays**  of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is  **minimum**.

Return  *the minimum sum of the lengths*  of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= arr.length <= 105
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
- 1 <= target <= 108

    public int minSumOfLengths(int[] arr, int target) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] best = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(best, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        int left = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            sum += arr[right];
            while (sum > target) {
                sum -= arr[left];
                left++;
            }
            if (sum == target) {
                int currLen = right - left + 1;
                if (left > 0 && best[left - 1] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    result = Math.min(result, best[left - 1] + currLen);
                }
                minLen = Math.min(minLen, currLen);
            }
            best[right] = minLen;
        }
        return result == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : result;
    }
}
```
