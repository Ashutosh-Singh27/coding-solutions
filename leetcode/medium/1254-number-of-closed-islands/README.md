# Number of Closed Islands

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a 2D `grid` consists of `0s` (land) and `1s` (water).  An  *island*  is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `0s` and a  *closed island*  is an island  **totally**  (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1s.`

Return the number of  *closed islands*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 1

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <=1

        for r in range(1, rows - 1):
            for c in range(1, cols - 1):
                if grid[r][c] == 0:
                    count += 1
                    dfs(r, c)

        return count
